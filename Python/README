In order to use the full functionality of the PipeTest3.py script, you must install matplotlib, which is a package for Matlab-style plotting in Python.  While you are at it, I suggest installing the scipy and numpy packages as well.
With these packages you can largely replace Matlab, for free.

To install these packages on ubuntu (assuming you are using python version 2.*):

sudo apt-get install python-scipy
sudo apt-get install python-numpy
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
